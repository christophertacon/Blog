## Introduction

Jupyter Notebooks are a web based application that enables users to create and share documents containing code, data visualisations, text, etc, in different programming languages. This workshop presents an introduction to Jupyter Notebooks and three packages which extend their functionality:
- **nbconvert**
- **nbdime**
- **nbval**

[**nbconvert**](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) allows the user to convert a Jupyter Notebook into different formats, such as PDF, LaTeX and many more. [**nbdime**](https://nbdime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a tool used to see the differences between two notebooks (diffing) or to merge two notebooks. Lastly, [**nbval**](https://github.com/computationalmodelling/nbval) is a plugin for pytest which validates the execution of the Notebook by checking that the output has not changed.Â 

For this workshop, Python3 will be used. No previous knowledge of Jupyter Notebooks is required, however coding skills are a plus.

## Pre-Requisites
### Installation on own machine
For working on your own machine, you will need:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- nbconvert
- nbdime
- nbval (version >= 0.5.0)

See [here]({filename}/Installation_Instructions.html) for installation instructions. You should also download all of the learning material, exercises and supporting material from [here]({filename}/Learning_Material.zip).

### Virtual Machine
We have also created a virtual machine which contains all of the necessary software and material for the workshop. If you prefer you can use VirtualBox and download the virtual machine labelled feeg6003_jupyternotebook from [here](www.soton.ac.uk/~ngcmbits/virtualmachines) to complete the workshop.

## Tutorial
### Learning Material and Exercises
All of the material created for this session is contained in Jupyter Notebooks. There is a main notebook which contains all of the learning material and exercises. This will guide you through using Jupyter Notebooks and the three packages listed above, ending with the exercises to practise what you have learnt.

### Supporting Material
A number of notebooks have been created to demonstrate the functionality of the three packages covered and will be referenced in the learning material.

### Download
You can download all of this material from [here]({filename}/Learning_Material.zip) and starting working through it.
