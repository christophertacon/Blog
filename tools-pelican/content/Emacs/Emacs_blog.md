#Emacs

Emacs is a customisable, self-documenting and fully extensible text editor. Emacs is freely available under the GNU license and is generally distributed with Linux operating systems. It has a Graphical and Terminal mode of operation and therefore makes it particularly appealing for HPC where remote editing of files is common.

#The Workshop
-
The aim of the workshop is to introduce the fundamental concepts and basic navigation for using Emacs. With Emacs being such a flexible and powerful editor the learning curve can be initially steep. As such, the workshop will contain live-demonstrations and exercises (text-editing and programming in c) to familiarise the user with using Emacs. After the workshop the user should have an understanding of the concepts behind Emacs and comfortable exploring more complex and powerful concepts within Emacs.

The workshop will consist of a presentation, live-demonstrations and exercises.


##Prerequisites

This workshop will require no previous knowledge of using Emacs. One exercise assumes knowledge of programming and compiling in C. 

Please bring a laptop to join in with the hands-on tutorials for using Emacs. A virtual machine is available which contains Emacs and gcc installed along with the documents to complete the tasks. This can be downloaded from: 

www.soton.ac.uk/~ngcmbits/virtualmachines.

The login username and password are feeg6003 and the task documents are stored in /home/feeg6003/Intro_to_Emacs.

Alternatively, you can download Emacs and a c compiler and simply download the tutorial documents from:
