If you do not currently have access to HDF5 you can download it for free using macports or from their website.

Part 1: HDF5 Command Line Tools
===============================

The HDF5 package comes with some helpful command line tools for use in viewing the files in the terminal

Exercise 1: Find the Code
=========================

The first exercise for this tutorial will be based on using the three terminal comamnds discussed in the first section of the presentation; h5ls, h5dump and h5copy. In the DIRECTORY inside the VirtualBox, you will find two HDF5 files. The objective here is to search these files to find a code and piece it together. This exercise begins with a clue in the attribute of the root group. Keep on collecting the correct datasets and copy them over to another HDF5 named solution.h5 in the format specified by the attributes. When you have completed this task, run the python file "codebreaker.py" and it will check your solution.h5 to see if what you have submitted is correct.

Exercise 2: Create your own file1
=================================

In the second part, you will have learned about using h5py and some of its features. This exercise will be about creating your own HDF5 file.


First look at Sublime Text 2
----------------------------

Once you have opened ST2 you will be presented with a window similar to that shown in Figure 1.

.. figure:: {filename}/text-editors-sublime/sublime-images/st2_first.png
   :width: 80%
   :alt: First view of Sublime Text 2
   :align: center

.. html::
	<div align="left">
		<b>Figure 1:</b> First look at Sublime Text 2
	</div>

The red numbers on the image are described below:

1. The taskbar. Here you should be able to access all the options for ST2. It is worth noting that all the menus/options are also accessible via the *Command Palette* which will be introduced later.
2. File tabs. Along this bar will be all the open files in that window/pane. You can either navigate through them by clicking on them or use the keys [kb:alt] + [kb:#] to move to the # file (where # is the number of the file from the left).
3. Overview pane (minimap). As you populate your file this will give you a zoomed-out view which can be useful for navigating through large files.
4. File syntax. This shows you what the syntax the file is being displayed in. ST2 will automatically select a syntax based on the file extension (e.g. if the file is .py then ST2 will choose Python). However if you want to change this then you can click on the writing and select your required syntax from the list. This is also achievable through the *Command Palette*.

There are many useful tools within ST2 and the following sections aim to give you an insight into those we find most valuable.

Built-in Goodies
----------------
"Projects" are one of the more useful features of ST2. This feature allows entire folders and their contents to be displayed in the side bar. This gives the user the ability to not only switch quickly between files in a number of directories, but also see what other files exist in the project at all times as in Figure 2. To do this, go to *File* > *Open Folder* and select a folder (Advanced Computational Methods Part II students, open ``~/comp_mod/blogs``). Additional folders can be added to the workspace, and the project can then be saved for another session under the *Project* tab.

   :alt: Projects in Sublime Text 2
   :align: center

.. html::
	<div align="left">
		<b>Figure 2:</b> Projects in Sublime Text 2
	</div>


While using ST2, you will notice the smart autocomplete pop-up. This is another handy gadget which works out of the box, and will suggest possible completions for a word you are typing based on similar words in the file, keywords for the file syntax etc.

In addition to these, "Snippets" and "Build Systems" are a powerful way to increase text-editing efficiency, and will be introduced once a few more packages are installed so that we can customise them for our blog entries.

Install Package Control
-----------------------

	Package control is the **Sublime Text** package manager that makes it exceedingly simple to find, install and keep packages up-to-date.

	-- https://packagecontrol.io

To get package control in ST2, firstly open ST2 and either push the keys [kb:ctrl] + [kb:'] (if you are working on a Virtual Machine, the Keyboard setup may not be the same as your host's - on a MacBook Air, the key [kb:'] was actually the [kb:ยง] key above tab). Alternatively go to *View* > *Show Console* . By doing this a white box at the bottom of your Sublime window should open as shown in Figure 3.

.. figure:: {filename}/text-editors-sublime/sublime-images/st2_console.png
   :width: 80%
   :alt: Screenshot of ST2 console.
   :align: center

.. html::
	<div align="left">
		<b>Figure 3:</b> Screenshot of console mode open in ST2
	</div>


Now follow this link_ and copy the code provided. Return to the ST2 window and paste the code into the console (i.e. the white box) and then hit return. This will install package control. You may be required to restart ST2 a couple of times depending on what is already installed on your machine.

.. _link: https://packagecontrol.io/installation#st2

An easy way to verify if package control is installed is to open the *Command Palette* with [kb:ctrl] + [kb:shift] + [kb:p] or going to *Tools* > *Command Palette...* . The Command Palette is a way to search ST2 for packages, syntax, snippets, ... in other words it is your best friend in ST2! It uses a search method called *fuzzy search* which allows the user to type keywords only partially and returns the closest matches, making it easy to find tools without needing to remember the exact name and wording. With the Command Palette open, start typing ``Package Control``. This should present you with all options available with regards to *Package Control* (this is how you will make use of *Package Control* later).

   :alt: Finding Package Control using the Command Palette
   :align: center

.. html::
	<div align="left">
		<b>Figure 4:</b> Finding Package Control using the Command Palette
	</div>


An alternative method to check if it is fully installed is to go to *Preferences* and you should see *Package Control* at the bottom of the list. By clicking on this it will open the *Command Palette* as described in the above paragraph. However, we thoroughly recommend learning the important key bindings such as [kb:ctrl] + [kb:shift] + [kb:p] to open the *Command Palette* as removing the need of the mouse to navigate will make your use of ST2 much more efficient.

Installing a Package
--------------------

We are going to install a package that improves the syntax of reStructuredText in ST2.

To install a package we need to open the *Command Palette* (with [kb:ctrl] + [kb:shift] + [kb:p] ) and type in ``Package Control: Install Package`` and select that entry (remember it is a *fuzzy search* so you don't need to type it all in). Now you are presented with a list of all the packages available to install via *Package Control*. Start typing ``RestructuredText Improved`` and select the entry that has the description: "Improved Syntax Highlighting for RestructuredText." This will download and install the package and should be functional immediately - this may seem strange and wonderful to users of other text editors whereby restarting the editor is the only method of invoking new tools.

To check, click in the bottom right-hand corner where the file syntax is displayed and see if there is one for ``reStructuredText Improved``. If so you have successfully installed the package.

.. figure:: {filename}/text-editors-sublime/sublime-images/st2_rst-improved.png

   :alt: RST improved syntax
   :align: center

.. html::
	<div align="left">
		<b>Figure 5:</b> Successful installation of the "RestructuredText Improved" package.
	</div>

There are many other useful packages available through *Package Control* but we just wanted to demonstrate how easy it is to install one! If your ideal package/tool does not exist however, then we need to learn to tweak ST2. Below are two ways to personalise ST2 for your own use: snippets and build systems.

Exercise 2: Snippets
====================

A snippet is best described as a smart template that will insert text for you and adapt it to its context. Snippets are very useful for short fragments of text that you use over and over again. A simple example is the "lorem" snippet that comes with ST2. In a new file type ``lorem`` followed by hitting the [kb:tab] key. This snippet will replace the single word "lorem" with the `Lorem ipsum`_ filler text.

.. _Lorem ipsum: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum

It is possible to see all the snippets available for that document format by either going to *Tools* > *Snippets* or by using the *Command Palette*. In here start typing *snippet*. A list should appear as shown in Figure 6. Try changing the syntax (Figure 1, point 4) to your favourite language and explore the built-in snippets!

.. figure:: {filename}/text-editors-sublime/sublime-images/st2_snippets.png
   :width: 60%
   :alt: Default snippet list for Plain Text syntax
   :align: center

.. html::
	<div align="left">
		<b>Figure 6:</b> Default snippet list for Plain Text syntax
	</div>


The first item in the list titled "Lorem ipsum" is the example we just used. Note that the short-cut to the snippet is displayed on the right as lorem,tab i.e. you can use the snippet as we did earlier: type ``lorem`` and hit [kb:tab] . We are now going to make our own snippet.

New Snippet...
--------------

This example builds on what was taught in the "`Introduction to Pelican`_" session. During that session we learnt to write a blog entry in ``.rst`` format. However, each time you start a new blog you have to firstly remember all the important metadata attributes and format them correctly. Therefore, to increase our efficiency we will build a snippet to do this for us.

.. _Introduction to Pelican: http://computationalmodelling.bitbucket.org/tools/pelican-basics.html

Firstly, it best to have a file with the extension that you want to build the snippet for open in ST2. This allows you to find the scope needed for the snippet and allows you to test it. On the virtual appliance we have supplied for the module, create a directory called ``my-blog`` under the path ``~/comp_mod/blogs/tools-pelican/content/`` then open a new file and save as ``blog-entry.rst`` in the ``my-blog`` directory so we can use it throughout this workshop. *Note: This can be done quickly with [kb:ctrl] + [kb:n] , then [kb:ctrl] + [kb:s] and use the file-save GUI.*

To build a new snippet we need to go to *Tools* > *New Snippet...* which will open a new file with the following code pre-entered:

.. code-block:: xml
	:linenos: inline

	<snippet>
	<content><![CDATA[
	Hello, ${1:this} is a ${2:snippet}.
	]]></content>
	    <!-- Optional: Set a tabTrigger to define how to trigger the snippet -->
	    <!-- <tabTrigger>hello</tabTrigger> -->
	    <!-- Optional: Set a scope to limit where the snippet will trigger -->
	    <!-- <scope>source.python</scope> -->
	</snippet>

There are three main lines of interest here:

**Line 3**
	This area (between the [ ] opened at the end of line 2 and closed on line 4) is the text that gets pasted into the file when you create the snippet. We will look at the format in a bit.

**Line 6**
	The code ``<tabTrigger>hello</tabTrigger>`` is where you define the tab-trigger to use the snippet.

**Line 8**
	The code ``<scope>source.python</scope>`` is where you define what file format you can apply the snippet.

We will firstly define the tab-trigger and the scope so that we can use it our file ``blog-entry.rst``. As the snippet will be creating the title and metadata a sensible tab-trigger would be ``title`` so replace line 6 with the following (**note:** to uncomment/comment lines push [kb:ctrl] + [kb:/] ):

.. code-block:: xml
	:linenos: inline
	:linenostart: 6

	    <tabTrigger>title</tabTrigger>

Next, cycle back to the ``.rst`` file and push [kb:ctrl] + [kb:shift] + [kb:alt] + [kb:p] to show the scope in the status bar at the bottom of the window, see Figure 7.

.. figure:: {filename}/text-editors-sublime/sublime-images/st2_scope.png
   :width: 40%
   :alt: Displaying the scope of a .rst file.
   :align: center

.. html::
	<div align="left">
		<b>Figure 7:</b> Display of the scope of a .rst file in the status bar.
	</div>

Copy ``text.restructuredtext`` into line 8 so that it reads:

.. code-block:: xml
	:linenos: inline
	:linenostart: 8

	    <scope>text.restructuredtext</scope>

Now we can start looking at the body of the snippet. Currently we have: ``Hello, ${1:this} is a ${2:snippet}.``. This contains two tab key markers which allow you to cycle through the fields that you wish to enter each time you use the snippet. The tab key markers are denoted by the ``$`` sign, and the number that follows it in the curly brace defines the cycle order (i.e. when you press [kb:tab] ). You can repeat the number if you want to fill in two fields with the same information. The word that follows the colon is the field text that you will replace when you start typing.

For our "blog title" snippet we will input the following for the content:

.. code-block:: xml

	<snippet>
	    <content><![CDATA[
	${1:Title}
	####${2:#}

	:authors: Your Name
	:date: ${3:2015-03-01}
	:tags: ${4:Tags}
	:slug: ${5:slug}

	${6:Starting typing content here...}
	    ]]></content>
	    <!-- Optional: Set a tabTrigger to define how to trigger the snippet -->
	    <tabTrigger>title</tabTrigger>
	    <!-- Optional: Set a scope to limit where the snippet will trigger -->
	    <scope>text.restructuredtext</scope>
	</snippet>

Now we just need to save it by selecting *File* > *Save as* or by pressing [kb:ctrl] + [kb:shift] +[kb:s] . The snippet needs to be saved under *\~* > *\.config* > *sublime-text-2* > *Packages* > *User* (ST2 should open the "Save" window in this directory by default) and must have the extension ``.sublime-snippet``. We suggest saving it as a sensible name such as ``rst-blog-title.sublime-snippet`` .

Now that it is saved it should work straight away. Navigate back to your ``.rst`` file and type in ``title`` followed by hitting [kb:tab] . The snippet should paste all the metadata into your file and allow you to tab through each field and let you update them. Fill in all these fields and add some content such as the classic "Hello World!" Finally, save this file for use in the next section.

Build Systems
=============

ST2 gives you the option to "build" the file you are working on (e.g. if you were working on a ``.c`` file you can run a C build system to compile the code and even run it). There are several build systems that come with ST2 such as C++ and python. However, we want to show you how you can make your own personal build system.

Sticking with the blogging theme, we are going to create a build system that allows you to generate the ``.html`` files and a "Run" option to locally view the ``index.html`` files in a browser.

Firstly, we need to create a new build system, so go to *Tools* > *Build System* > *New Build System...* which will open a new file. Like many other ST2 settings files, build systems are written in Java Script Object Notation (JSON) format, requiring key word and argument pairs. The default new build system should look like this:

.. code-block:: json

 	{
	    "cmd": ["make"]
	}

In here we will place our commands that we would normally type as a bash command. To start we need to give a command to navigate to where the ``Makefile`` is and then use it. The most robust way to do this is to start from a known point i.e. your home. In the case of the virtual appliance we have supplied, the path will be ``~/comp_mod/blogs/tools-pelican``. Then we can add the command ``make html`` as shown below. It is also good to add a ``selector`` field that means this build system only works on specific file types and will be automatically selected by ST2 (in this case we want it to work on ``text.restructuredtext`` files).

.. code-block:: json

	{
	    "cmd": ["bash", "-c", "cd ~/comp_mod/blogs/tools-pelican && make html"],
	    "selector": "text.restructuredtext"
	}

If we now save this in the user directory ``~/.config/Sublime Text 2/Packages/User``as ``pelican-blog.sublime-build`` (again the extension ``.sublime-build`` is required) and then return to editing to the ``blog-entry.rst`` file that was created above and we can use this build system. To use the build system either go to *Tools* > *Build System*  and select the *pelican-blog* system, or alternatively, press [kb:ctrl] + [kb:b] . Upon doing this the bash output of the commands will be displayed at the bottom of the screen as shown in Figure 9.

.. figure:: {filename}/text-editors-sublime/sublime-images/st2_build.png
   :width: 80%
   :alt: A successful pelican blog build.
   :align: center

.. html::
	<div align="left">
		<b>Figure 9:</b> A successful pelican blog build system.
	</div>

To add the option (or a variant) of viewing the output once you have built it you can update the build system as follows:

.. code-block:: json

	{
	    "cmd": ["bash", "-c", "cd ~/comp_mod/blogs/tools-pelican && make html"],
	    "selector": "text.restructuredtext",

	    "variants":
	    [
	        {
	            "name": "Run",
	            "cmd": ["bash", "-c", "cd ~/comp_mod/blogs/tools-pelican && make html && cd ~/comp_mod/blogs/tools && firefox index.html"]
	        }
	    ]
	}

This variant is called "Run" and carries out the same commands as "Build" but also opens the local ``index.html`` in a firefox browser. The name "Run" was chosen as it comes with the predefined key-binding [kb:ctrl] + [kb:shift] + [kb:b] and an option in the *Tools* drop down menu. You can add multiple variants to perform other tasks, however, they won't be available in to drop down menu; instead you can find them in the *Command Palette* ( [kb:ctrl] + [kb:shift] + [kb:p] ) and search for ``Build: <variant name>``, or add a personal key-binding under ``Preferences > Key Bindings - User`` (again in the JSON format: see ``Key Bindings - Default`` for the format).

Additional Exercises
====================

As an extra challenge, we have provided a problem you may like to try to practise personalising ST2:

1. Create an ANSI-C build system with flags ``-ansi -pedantic -Wall`` (as used in `FEEG6002 - Advanced Computational Methods 1`_)

.. _FEEG6002 - Advanced Computational Methods 1: http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~feeg6002/toolsc.html

2. Write hello.c to print "Hello World" to stdout (for example)
3. Use the C build-system to compile hello.c program and run/display output to console
4. Add a new variant called "save_output" in the build system to pipe the stdout feed to `output.txt` or a similar output log file
5. Add a keybind to the save_output build variant (see default keybindings for `"variant": "Run"`)
6. Check your output file in sublime
   
We also suggest looking at using ST2 for building LaTeX documents by following these rough steps (aimed at Linux systems):

1. If you haven't already, install a tex-live distribution, latexmk and evince reader through the terminal (i.e. using apt-get)
2. Download, via Package Control, the package "LaTeXTools"
3. Got to *Preferences* > *Package Settings* > *LaTeXTools* and click on *Reconfigure LaTeXTools and migrate settings*.
4. Create a minimal .tex file the compile using LaTeXTools (i.e. [kb:ctrl] + [kb:b] ).
