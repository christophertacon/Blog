About the workshops
-------------------

Each 'workshop' is introducing a topic/tool/software/technique that is useful for research in computational modelling. Working through this should take about an hour. Each workshop aims to introduce a topic, to put it in context, and aims to provide an understanding of what use of it may look like in practice. This is combined with a practical exercise, and pointers that allow further learning.

About the workshop authors and teachers
---------------------------------------

The workshops are developed by students of the `FEEG6003 Advanced Computational Modelling 2 <http://www.soton.ac.uk/~feeg6003>`__, a module delived by Denis Kramer, Ian Hawke, Peter Horak and Hans Fangohr at the University of Southampton. The module is part of the compulsory training for students in Southampton's EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Next Generation Computational Modelling, but is open for other undegraduate and postgraduate students as well.
